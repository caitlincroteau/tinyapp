# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Users must register or login to create and store short URLs in their user profile. Users can only edit or delete the short URLs stored in their profile. Once a user creates a short URL, it can be used by anyone to access the corresponding long URL.
